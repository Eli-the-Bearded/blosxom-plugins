# blosxom 2 plugin onlyone_filter
# author: stu mackenzie
# support: zero

# This plugin aims to restrict posted entries to *only* the dir specified 
# in the calling url. I imagine it will produce no stories when called 
# with a date.

At whatever directory a blog is called, only stories within that directory will be 
displayed. For instance, if you call:
  www.example.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/animals/mammals/rodents/
then only stories in the /rodents directory will be displayed

Likewise, if you call: 
  www.example.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/animals/mammals/rodents/index.html
then only stories in the /rodents directory will be displayed
