=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: page_titler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This allows for the title of the most recent story to be used in flavours, available with $page_titler::title . In this current version, the first page view after a story has changed will be the second newest title. While loading, the cache file will be overwritten with the new title and all subsequent uses will have the current title.
