Thanks for trying Sxtem! I hope you like it and find it useful.

Requirements:
Bloxsom (Tested on 2.0 b5)
Ruby (Tested on 1.6.7)
xml-rpc4r (Get the latest: http://www.fantasy-coders.de/ruby/xmlrpc4r/)
A blogger-api client. w.bloggar works fairly well.

Installation:
Make sure that your web server process has write access to your
data dir and all its subdirectories. (Folders for you Mac users)
To do this, use the chmod command, set permissions to 777 on all
directories.

Copy sxtem.cgi and Articles.rb into your web directory.
I put mine in the root.

Edit the configuration variables in the sxtem.cgi file
to fit your bloxsom install. The values should be obvious
except for the username and password: those are the values that
you'll be using to log in via your blogging tool.

w.bloggar setup:
With a new w.bloggar install, run the program.
Enter your "user" and "pass" variables in the "Username" and "Password"
w.bloggar fields. Make sure the blog pull-down says "New" ("Custom"
for existing installs)

API Server tab:
Host - the url of your server, less pathnames. (IE: www.greenman.org)
Page - the path to your sxtem.cgi. (IE: /sxtem.cgi)
leave the rest default unless you know what you're doing. ;)

Proxy Server tab:
Leave it default unless you have a proxy server.

Custom:
Posts - Blogger API
Categories: metaWeblog API - Single

Leave the rest default.

Please email me with any comments and ideas. Patches are lovingly welcomed.
Once I get the feel for the thing, I'll consider making a plugin in Perl.
This is my first Ruby project ever, so be nice.
