#
# Generate a list of links included in a journal entry.
#
# Description
#
#   Linksused will create a list of links referenced in a story to
#   provide a handy-dandy little index.  The text of these links can be
#   either the URL they point to or plain text.  If you set the flag to
#   use a text link (rather than the URL), the text will be the contents
#   of the title attribute of the anchor if it exists or the original
#   link text. 
#
#   That is, if your story includes this link:
#
#   <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/" title="Blosxom homepage">blosxom</a>
#
#   then linksused would include the following link:
#
#   <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom homepage</a>
#
#   if you set the flag to "link" or this link:
#
#   <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">http://www.blosxom.com/</a>
#
#   if the flag is set to "url".  Further, if you are using the URL as
#   the link text, you have the option of limiting its length with the
#   urllength variable. 
#
#   The list of links is packaged up as an unordered list (<ul>) with
#   each link being a list item (<li>).  The list will have a header
#   which can be set by changing the value of the link_hdr variable. 
#
#   This plugin was originally written by Gregory Bair.  
#
# Usage
#
#   Simply drop include "$linksused::linksused" in your story flavour 
#   file whereever you want the list to appear.
#
# Configuration
#
#   There are three variables you can use to configure linksused:
#
#     o link_or_url  - Controls whether the linked text will be actual
#                      text or the linked URL
#     o urllength    - If the URL is listed as the link, this controls
#                      the maximum length.  URL's longer than this will
#                      be truncated and have an elipse (...) appended.
#     o link_hdr     - Title displayed above the list of links
#
#   All three variables can be left set to their default values.
#

#   Unknown     V2.0    GB      Last Released Version from Gregory Bair
#   01.24.2005  V3.0    RLS     Added use of the title attribute as the
#                               text of the linksused links.  Also put
#                               the links into an unordered list (<ul>)
#                               and added a variable to control the
#                               title of the list (list_hdr).

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: linksused

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Populates $linksused::linksused with a list of the links referenced to in that story.  Maybe not so useful, but I think it's neat, and it taught me a bit about Perl regular expressions.

=head1 Changelog

2 - Got rid of HTML::LinkExtor module and used regexp matching instead.  
    Offered choice of link url or linked text.
    Very much improved over v1.
