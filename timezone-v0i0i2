=head1 DESCRIPTION

The format for $blog_timezone is the same as for the tzset command 
(www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/tzset.3.html).

$timezone::name can be used in flavors, like this:
...posted: $hr:$min $timezone::name...

=head1 BUGS

This plugin can't be disabled by appending an underscore to the filename 
(timezone_).  I don't think this should cause any problems, but I might 
be wrong.
