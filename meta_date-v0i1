=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: personLink

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: After noticing that some Google queries sport a date, I investigated further and found that Google looks for tags like this:

	<meta name="Date" content="2004-01-15" />

This plugin is used to augment your templates by adding in this meta tag for all individual entries.


=head1 PREQUISITES

None.

=head1 DETAILS

This plug-in is designed only for those blogs that are configured to display single posts.  You'll know what I mean if your style of permalinking is not to reference a post with an anchor in the URI, but a link to the post itself.

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

The meta tag can only really be formatted one way, so the only customization available is to set the timezone, and to allow posting the time of the post.

$tz -- sets the timezone.

The best way to find out your timezone offset is probably to go visit this page: http://timezoneconverter.com/ 

When you conduct a search of your location, you'll be presented with a table of results. In one of the columns, you'll see a field that looks something like this:

  -00:05:00:00

To convert that value into something for this plug-in, remove the first pair of zeros, and all colons.  It'll then look like this:

  -050000

If the last pair of digits are both zeros, they may be omitted:

  -0500

$showtime -- indicates whether you want time info in the meta tag

Allowed values are "1" (for yes) and "0" (for no)


=head1 VERSION
