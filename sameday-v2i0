=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: sameday

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose:
I don't know if this is a usefull one. Got the idea from some Userland weblogs. 
Use $sameday::sameday in your story template to make a link to the same day of the posting date 
of your posting, but then in the last year.

Link will only be available if there is a posting for that date. 
Works probably only in static mode. 


=head1 VERSION
