=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: redirecterror

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Put this plugin on your plugins directory and you are all set.
It will check if the URL requested actually exists on the
filesystem.  If it does, the plugin does nothing. If it doesnt, the
plugin goes up $blosxom::path_info looking for the next valid path
on your filesystem and when it finds one redirects the browser to it.
If that also fails, the browser is redirected to $blosxom::url.
You should put this plugin right at the start of your list by naming it
something like 00redirecterror.
