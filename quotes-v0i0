Blosxom Plug-in: quotes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Populates $quotes::quotes with the contents of the newest of any story
with '$quotes::quotes_path' in its path.

accessible variable for use in flavours. The disposition of any remaining quotes is
configurable.

Configurable variables:

   $quotes::before_quotes: prepend the quote with this
   $quotes::after_quotes: put this after the quote
   $quotes::quotes_path: the full path to the quotes category
   $quotes::quotes_link: link the quote to the quotes category
   $quotes::delete_quotes: remove the quote stories unless we're displaying the quotes category
   $quotes::pop_quotes: remove the story containing the newest quote
