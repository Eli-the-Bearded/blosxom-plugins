=head1 NAME

strip_unix_comments - remove any line beginning with a I<#> character.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 Put this file in your I<bloxsom> plug-ins directory.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Remove any line beginning with a I<#> character.

By convention most Unix tools treat the I<#> character and any content
following it up to the end of the line as comments which are neither
interpreted or displayed outside of the document itself.

It a bloxsom context, you might want to CVS your source files and include
a variety of version control stamps (Id, Log, etc.) that should not be
displayed when rendered as HTML.
