=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: logger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin stores CGI environment variables in a text file, much like a mini-server log. It stores this information in a text file you specify with the $log variable.  You should be able to access environment variables with $logger::remoteIP, $logger::referrer and so on, if you wanted to display any of the environment variable values within your template for some reason.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0+3i

had bug report from Fletcher that logger plug in crashed web servers if file permissions were not set to allow writing.
added "or die" to each line that write to the log file
do not have means to test this fix and see if it works.  Use at your own risk!

Version 0+2i

=head2 VERSION HISTORY: 0+2i

added date and time stamp code to logger plug in.  
appended documentation to end of plugin in PerlDoc format.
Fletcher contributed code to filter out IPs you do not want to include in your logs and refined the log file location variable. THANK YOU, FLETCHER!

=head2 VERSION HISTORY: 0+1i

initial test version

=head1 BUGS

I am sure there are plenty because I am a novice Perl programmer. Please report them to me at mischief@toad.net.

Logger plugin does not currently support file locking, which it really should. I am trying to figure out how file locking works in Perl-- will add after I figure out how to do it.
