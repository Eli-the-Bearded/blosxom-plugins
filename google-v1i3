=head1 NAME
	
google: Turn a string of keywords in a blog entry into a link
	to search at Google.
	
=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: A string of keywords can be included as the second line
of a Blosxom story (after the title) and these keywords will be
crafted into a URL that fires off a search at google. Optionally
the query can take place in a separate window.

=head1 VERSION

0.2

=head1 USAGE

Add a line in your story beginning with meta-google_keywords: and
then one or more words that you wish to be in your google query string.

You can still use the old way, which required a line containing 
KW: somewhere in it, but this is now deprecated. This module will work
with BOTH types, but I recommend using the meta version. Obviously this
requires the meta plugin, and it must run BEFORE this one, so name it
appropriately.

=head1 DEPRECATED USAGE

You must specify a keyword indicator string, the default is "KW:".
This should be the first string on the SECOND line of a Blosxom
story. You may hide this keyword string inside an HTML comment, in
which case the comment character would be the first string on the line.
Each word is joined with a "+" to create the link. You have control
over what the link should look like and also where you put it. This
plugin exposes $google::google for each story; if no keywords were
specified/found, then this variable will be empty.
