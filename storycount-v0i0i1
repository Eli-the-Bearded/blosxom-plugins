0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a filter plugin that counts the number of stories and makes that 
count avaiable as the variable $storycount::count.

This filter should be the last filter run; if any other filter runs after 
it, that filter can change the count. To make this the last filter, you may 
wish to rename the file to "90storycount" or whatever is suitable for your 
plugin directory.


=head1 LIMITATIONS

This plugin runs as a "filter" subroutine. Since the story subroutine, 
which runs next, can "skip" a story, in theory the count can become 
inaccurate. Since I've never run across a story plugin that "skips," I have 
no suggestions at this time how to accomodate that situation.

=head1 BUGS

No known bugs.
