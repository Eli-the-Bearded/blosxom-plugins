# Blosxom Datadir and pluginstate directory for each hostname.
# Note that you need to create the state directory and make it world writeable 
# so that the webserver can write to it appropriately.


# The format for each line should be the following "domain name" => ["datadir", "plugin state dir"],

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: vhost

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin is designed for people that wish to have multiple Blosxom weblogs, each with
their own vhost.  

It traps requests for the script that use the listed vhost and sets $blosxom::datadir to 
the specified location.


=head2 Usage

Be sure this plug-in sits BEFORE all other plug-ins.  To force this, rename it 
to 00vhost.
 
This plugin works in concert with the "config" plug-in, without which it
won't allow individual weblogs to override the global Blosxom configuration by
placing config files in their $datadir.

Aside from this simple renaming, about all that should be needed is to 
set a DirectoryIndex to /blosxom.cgi with a ScriptAlias /blosxom.cgi to the 
actual script for the directory where the domain is server from,
replacing the paths as appropriate to your particular setup, of course.


=head2 Warning

Be sure to choose a $datadir _outside_ of the user's personal 
Web-accessible document-root.  In other words, don't use a $datadir of
/home/$username/www/weblog or the like, where anything under /home/$username/www
is world-readable.

=head2 Limitations

This plug-in doesn't yet allow for individual weblogs to have their own plugin direcotries.  I based this off the isp plugin
which mentioned this as well since there is a race condition between multiple plugin directories.

=head1 BUGS

Please address all bug reports to the author.

This plugin does not cooperate well with categories on its own.  To use categories, you need to use an address like
http://yourvhost/blosxom.cgi/your/category/here/ or use mod_rewrite in apache in order to 
make apache look at the script on its own.

In my setup I use the following rewrite rules in the .htaccess file, but it should work
the same from the apache config file as well.

DirectoryIndex blosxom.cgi
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /blosxom.cgi/$1 [L,PT]

This causes apache to rewrite the URL in the server if the request is not for a file. 
This means that requests for a specific file will be processed and the webserver will return the file, 
but otherwise, the path info and or the date info in the URL will be passed to the blosxom
script.  This allows this plugin to cooperate with permanent links based on date as well as categories.
