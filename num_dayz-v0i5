#
#  Blosxom normally displays the most recent $num_entries 
#  posts (5, 10, 100); num_dayz displays posts from the 
#  most recent $num_days days (3 days, 7 days, 30 days). 
#  The maximum number of posts that will be displayed is 
#  still set by $num_entries. The plugin can detect whether 
#  you're sorting by ascending or descending date.
#
#  num_dayz takes a real slash-and-burn approach when limiting
#  entries to the specified time range: blosxom still composes 
#  $num_entries stories for the page; num_dayz just doesn't 
#  allow the "later" ones to display. This behavior won't win  
#  any efficiency contests, but it lets num_dayz work without 
#  changing blosxom's list of %files, and that (should) mean that 
#  other plugins won't break. To save processor time, load num_dayz 
#  fairly early among plugins that use the story() routine; I can 
#  name it 00num_dayz and everything works fine.

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: num_dayz


=head1 SYNOPSIS

* Entries from the most-recent $num_days are displayed, instead of 
  the normal $num_entries posts. (However, $num_entries still sets 
  the limit on how many posts from the most-recent $num_days days 
  will be displayed.)

* If the blog is sorted by descending date (normal), num_dayz counts 
  backward from the newest entry; if the sort is by ascending date, 
  num_dayz counts forward from the oldest entry.

* num_dayz can be set to start counting days from the most recent 
  entry date, or from the current date.

* No matter what settings are used, at least one entry will always 
  be displayed.


=head1 INSTALLATION

Locate the num_dayz plugin you downloaded; open the file and enter 
the two CONFIGURATION values; save the file with unix line ends. 
Upload or drop the num_dayz file into your blosxom plugins folder. 
Blog on.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

With any luck, the instructions in the "Configuration Section" 
at the top of this file are sufficient; if more information is 
needed, see the documentation at:
  http://www.enilnomi.net/dltext/num_dayz.dl


=head1 USAGE NOTES

num_dayz normally counts days from the newest post: e.g. if today is 
the 20th, and you tell num_dayz to count 5 days, and the most-recent 
entries in the blog are from the 18th and 12th, num_dayz will display 
entries for the 5 days from the 18th to the 13th. (That is, both posts 
mentioned above will display.)

When $now_mode is set to 1, num_dayz counts days from right now: e.g. 
if today is the 20th, and you tell num_dayz to count 5 days from now, 
and the most-recent entries in the blog are from the 18th and 12th, 
num_dayz will display entries for the 5 days from now (the 20th) to 
the 15th. (That is, only one of the posts mentioned above will display.)

If no posts meet the requirements of the $num_days and $now_mode 
settings, the plugin will display at least one entry.
