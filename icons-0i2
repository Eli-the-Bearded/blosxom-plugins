#------------------- Configurable Options --------------------

#Ok, there's two ways to do this.  Choices: "basic" or "advanced".  Basic
#is for those who either want to keep their images in one place or who don't
#have their data directory in a public place.  Advanced requires that the 
#data directory be under the document root of your server.
$basic_or_advanced = "basic";

#The basic way: Put your icons in a directory specified by $icons_url.
#Name your icons according to the category (i.e. for /Computers, you would
#name it Computers.gif or .png or whatever as indicated by $icons_ext).
#This way only displays top-level categories.
$icons_url = "/images";
$icons_ext = qq!png!;

#The Advanced way: Put your images in your category directories,
#and name them according to $pub_icon_fn.
$icon_fn = qq!icon.png!;
$datadir_url = "";
