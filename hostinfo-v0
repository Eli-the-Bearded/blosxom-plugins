=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: hostinfo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin determines the name of the current host, based on the $blosxom::url
variable, exported as $hostinfo::hostname.

In addition, I use it to hang onto other variables that I would like to keep track of
and set up $hostinfo::do_replacement to handle the translation.
