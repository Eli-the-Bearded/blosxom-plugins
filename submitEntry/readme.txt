This is a simple alteration of the submission plugin; it allows to enter a body text, to specify subdirectory and to specify author.
It includes sample templates (which will normally go in the datadir) and an auxiliary plugin that gives the list of existing subdirectories, for use by the templates. You can create an entry through 
http://localhost/cgi/blosxom.cgi/index.submit
Be aware that this plugin raises security issue; combine it with the login plugin. Also note that your document directory must be writable by the web user.
I hope this works for you.
