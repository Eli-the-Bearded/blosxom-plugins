=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: page_titler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This allows for the title of the most recent story to be used in flavours, available with $page_titler::title . In this current version, the first page view after a story has changed will be the second newest title. While loading, the cache file will be overwritten with the new title and all subsequent uses will have the current title. As of version 0.2, the titles are stored by what page was loaded, which allows for multiple titles. Configuration variables are available to turn on or off the use of the titles in the date views and category views.
