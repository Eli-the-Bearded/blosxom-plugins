# Limits blosxom's display to only those entries which are
# located in the directory specified in the URL. For example,
# with these directories:
#   /animals
#   /animals/mammals
#   /animals/mammals/rodents
#   /animals/mammals/rodents/porcupines
# a browser pointed to
#   www.example.com/blosxom.cgi/animals/mammals
# will display only the stories located directly in the
# /mammals directory; nothing from /rodents or /porcupines
# will be displayed. Similarly, if you call:
#   www.example.com/blosxom.cgi/index.html
# only entries located directly in your datadir will display;
# nothing from /animals, /mammals, /rodents, or /porcupines
# will appear.

# -- NOTE -----
# If the specified directory contains *no* entry files,
# blosxom will produce an empty page. You should think
# about using the nixie plugin or emptymessage plugin
# to guard against this condition.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Displays entries from *only* the directory specified in the URL. 
For instance, if you have a path: /animals/mammals/rodents, and 
you point your browser to: example.com/blosxom.cgi/animals/mammals, 
*only* the entries from /mammals will be displayed; no entries from 
/rodents will appear.


=head1 INSTALLATION

No configuration is needed; just drop this file into your blosxom 
plugins folder. Blog on.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

No configuration is needed.


=head1 USAGE

Here's an example of using onlyonedir, exclude, and config to 
create a customized "welcome page":

Let's say that you'd prefer visitors see one or two "introductory" 
entries when they first hit your site, instead of the normal display 
of blog entries. Here's your directory structure:
 /blosxom
     /Welcome.txt
     /Terms and Conditions.txt
     /Life
         /College Life
         /Married Life
         /Next Life
     /Death
         /Death of a Salesman
         /Death of a Dream
         /Death to Smoochy

Now, you want folks to see the "intro" entries *only* when they hit 
the root level of the blog; they should be hidden at all other times. 
And, you want folks to see *only* the "intro" entries when they first 
hit the blog; no other entries should display. Here's what to do ---

1) Set up the exclude plugin to never display the intro entries. Your 
   exclude file, stored at the top level of your blog, will be:
     Welcome.txt
     Terms and Conditions.txt

2) Set up onlyonedir to load in standby mode, by naming it:
     onlyonedir_

3) Create a top-level configuration file (or edit your existing file) 
   with these settings:
     $path_info eq "" and $path_info_yr eq "" and $plugins{onlyonedir} = 1;
     $path_info eq "" and $path_info_yr eq "" and $plugins{exclude} = 0;

That's it. When folks first hit your blog, they'll get your "intro" 
articles. If they enter a date-based URL, they'll get anything *but* 
your "intro" articles.

(Cavaet: for this to work, your config plugin must run during filter(), 
not head(). If you use Rael's version of config, change "sub head {" to 
"sub filter {", and you're good to go.)

To disable onlyonedir via config file, use this line:
 $onlyonedir::onlyonedir_on = 0;
