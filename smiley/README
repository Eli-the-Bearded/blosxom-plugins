Smiley
v 0.1

by Jeff Stoner <leapfrog@freeshell.org>

This Blosxom plugin is based on John Slee's 'googletag' plugin.

Install:
copy the smiley script to your plugins directory.
copy/move the images to a location on your docroot
configure the script according to the comments at the top

You can add more smiley tags and images if you so desire.

The images included were shamelessly ripped from www.deadcat.net (the
Big Brother script archive) because I have no abilities as an artist.
I've included the readme.txt from the author of the original images
so as to give him the credit he deserves.
