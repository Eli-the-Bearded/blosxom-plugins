=head NAME

Blosxom Plugin: visitors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Computes how many people are "currently" visiting your site and, if you have the login plugin installed, how many are logged in.  The timeout (seconds) for how long to consider a person active in is customizable (default of 120), as well as configurable with the config plugin.

This plugin simply provides the following variables to the templates:

$visitors::guests is the number of unknown users

$visitors::member is the number of logged-in users

$visitors::total is the number of both guests and members


I use something like the following in my header template, along with some HTML formatting:

    $visitors::total User Online
    $visitors::guests guests
    $visitors::members members
