=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: rendertime

=head1 USAGE

Just drop this into your blosxom plugins directory and make sure it is the
first plugin that will be run (i.e. rename to B<00rendertime> or whatever).
Then for each request this plugin will print a line to the log file showing
the time, in seconds (x.xxxx), it took to render the page.

If B<$logToFile> is set to 0 then this plugin will print the render time to
the web server error log.  If you don't want the render time log file located
in the plugin state directory then change B<$logFile> accordingly.

This plugin requires the B<gettimeofday> system call.

Note that this plugin could parse the render time log file and export a 
variable containing an average render time per page or something interesting.
