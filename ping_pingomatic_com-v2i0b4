=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: ping_weblogs_com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Notifies pingomatic.com [http://www.pingomatic.com] that your weblog
has been updated upon encountering any new story. 

Visit pingomatic.com and select the services that you would like to ping and click submit. Copy the URL of the 'thank you' page to "my $ping_url".

Make sure you are pinging the address that is listed with other services. For example, if you claimed your weblog at technorati with the address http://timswebpage.com/, then you should fill in the 'blog url' field on pingomatic with http://timswebpage.com/. Adding the additional cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/ bit confuses some of the services.

Maintains a touch-file ($blosxom::plugin_state_dir/.ping_weblogs_com.output)
to which to compare the newest story's creation date.  Fills the
touch-file with the HTML results of the latest ping.

=head1 VERSION
