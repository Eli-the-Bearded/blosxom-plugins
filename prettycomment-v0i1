# A bloxsom plugin to fix the comment/comments problem that annoys people so much.
# (i've seen a load of fixes for this, but this ones almost drag and drop)

package prettycomment;

# --- Configurable variables -----

# Where are writebacks kept?
my $wb_dir = "/home/security/blogplugins/state/writeback";

# What file extension is used for writebacks? 
my $wb_extension = "wb";

# Here are the writeback strings, use $prettycomment::wb_comment in your flavours
my @writeback_string = ("comments, click here to add the first", # if there are no writebacks
			"comment", 				 # if there is only 1 writeback
			"comments");				 # if there is more than 1


# There are no more user configurable variables

How to use:

Copy file to your plugin directory, as "prettycomment", case sensitive.

Find some thing looking similar to, where you have "$writeback::count comments" in your story flavour, and replace with "$writeback::count $prettycomment::wb_comment"
