=head1 Name

Blosxom Plug-In: defer

=head1 Synopsis

A bit of defense against a particularly tenacious referer spammer.  A one-trick pony
for now, but eventually will get expanded to combat other sorts of referer spam (as 
time permits).

=head1 Quick Start

Just drop it in your $plugin_dir.  There is only one config variable, which 
you shouldn't need to change, at least until this jerk gets chased to another
hosting provider with another IP.

Deferer tries to save your server a few cycles by ending the entire blosxom run (via 
exit(0)) once a redirect header has been sent.  To save the most time, make this plugin
run first by naming it 00deferer.

=head1 More Info

For lots more info, see the SEE ALSO section below.
  
In a nutshell, tons of referer spam is currently being sent out with
hundreds of refer'ed URIs.  They all resolve to one IP address - 161.58.59.8.  When visited,
they all show a fake 'hosting account suspended' message.  Days later the sites come on line
with live links to poker sites and other junk.  Same rig is sending tons of comment spam
using info harvested previously.

The traffic comes through many proxies and zombie machines, so instead of checking the 
remote ip, we block anyone using one of the referers.  Because we can, we send a redirect 
right back to the offending URL.  Let 'em waste their own bandwith.
