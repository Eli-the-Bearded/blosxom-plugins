NAME
    Blosxom Plug-in: paginate

DESCRIPTION
    Provide a simple page navigation capability in a Blosxom blog, allowing
    a reader to flip through ranges of stories with a previous link, next
    link, and a list of available pages. Page length is defined by the
    `$num_entries' setting in the main blosxom config.

    The following variables are available for display in Blosxom templates:

    * $paginate::prev_link
        Contains link to previous page, is empty if a this link is not
        valid.

    * $paginate::link_list
        Contains the entire list of links to available pages.

    * $paginate::next_link
        Contains link to next page, is empty if a this link is not valid.

    The display of previous, next, and page links is customizable via
    flavoured templates (each with a .$flavour extension):

    * paginate_prev_link
        Used to build a previous page link.

        Default: <a href="$prev_url">&lt;&lt;- prev</a>

    * paginate_next_link
        Used to build a next page link.

        Default: <a href="$next_url">next -&gt;&gt;</a>

    * paginate_list_start
        Placed at the start of the page list.

        Default: " [ "

    * paginate_list_join
        Placed in between page list items.

        Default: " | "

    * paginate_list_item
        Used to display page list items other than the current page.

        Default: <a href="$curr_url">$curr_number</a>

    * paginate_list_curr_item
        Used to display the current page in the list.

        Default: <b>$curr_number</b>

    * paginate_list_end
        Placed at the end of the page list.

        Default: " ] "

    By default, these templates construct simple links to blog pages. In
    customizing these templates, many other forms of page navigation are
    possible. For example, with a little bit of Javascript, the prev/next
    links can become buttons and the page list can become a drop-down
    selector. An example of this is included with the distribution archive
    for this plugin.
