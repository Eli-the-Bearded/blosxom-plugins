=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: DoYouYahoo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Blosxom users with AOL Instant Messenger accounts could use the AIMStatus plugin to let their readers know if they were currently available on AIM or not.  However, I could not find a plugin for Blosxom users that did the same thing for Yahoo Messenger.  This plugin adopts Yahoo's "Online Presence" HTML into something Blosxom users can add to their sites to let readers know if they are available on Yahoo Messenger.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Put this plugin in your plugin directory and set the $YahooID variable to your Yahoo Messenger ID.  Then, just add $doyouyahoo::display to your flavour template somewhere.
