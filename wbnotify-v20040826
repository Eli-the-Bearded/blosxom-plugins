# Documentation: See the bottom of this file or type: perldoc wbnotify
# Requirements: writebacks -plugin and a sendmail compatible mailer (most on
#               unixen). On Windows, you can use 'Blat', a command-line
#               mailer. You can find it here: http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/blat.html
#               (on windows you'll also have to modify the sendmail variable!)

package wbnotify;

# --- Configurable variables -----

# Address that writebacks will be mailed to.
# *** This plugin will not action until you set it. ***
# my $wbaddr = 'your@target.email.here.invalid';
 
# Location of sendmail -executable. If default doesn't work, try to find the
# right location and replace this variable with it.
# This may help you find something suitable:
# for i in `locate sendmail`; do if [ -x $i ]; then echo $i; fi; done;
my $sendmail = "/usr/lib/sendmail";

# --------------------------------

use CGI qw/:standard/;

sub start {

    # We're not entitled to action as we don't know the target address
    warn "blosxom : wbnotify plugin > The \$wbaddr variable is not set; please set it to enable writeback notifications.\n";

  }
