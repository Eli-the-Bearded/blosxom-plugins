=head1 NAME

Blosxom plugin: scase

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sentence Case (SCase)

SCase allows the use of capitalized directory names without losing the
ability to resolve lowercase URIs. Currently only makes the path case-
insensitive: filenames in permalinks are still case-sensitive.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

There are no user-configured variables. Simply drop into your Blosxom
plugins directory. Since SCase munges some core Blosxom variables, it
needs to load before anything else uses $path

1. Converts the requested path, $blosxom::path_info, to sentence case
allowing all-lowercase urls to be used.

This is useful since very few people (in the ordinary, mundane sense of the word: I would never be grouping anyone who would have occasion to read this
as one of the masses) know that URIs are case-sensitive. Out of laziness, most
people type only lowercase letters, even if the path contains uppercase
letters. This allows an all-lowercase path to "find" its capitalized
counterpart.

2. Provides all-lowercase story path ($blosxom::path) to be used in links.
To turn this option on, uncomment line 18. Really only useful if you are
using capitalized directory names but for some reason only want to present
lowercase links to the world at large.

Future Work: I'd like to extend the functionality to case-insensitive file-
names ($blosxom::$fn), for truly case-insensitive permalinks. Unfortunately,
that's a bit out of my league. Some help, maybe?
