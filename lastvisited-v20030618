=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: lastvisited

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In cooperation with the cookie plugin and the lastmodified plugin, the lastvisited plugin
marks 'new' stories. A 'new' story is defined as "a story that a previous visitor hasn't read yet.;"
Brand-new visitors (and visitors who don't save cookies) won't have stories marked, since by
definition they're all new stories...

There are a couple of configurable variables:

   $lastvisited::new_class: the new marker is enclosed in a &lt;span&gt; of this class
   $lastvisited::new_marker: the marker to prefix the story with (it will end up at the end of the title of the post)
