Blosxom Plug-in: test

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is just a test plugin to help make sure your plugin setup works.  Just drop it in your plugin directory and load your blog.  You should see "TESTING...plugin found, loaded and run." above your posts.  It might even appear twice.  This will let you know that your plugins are being found, loaded, and run by blosxom.  If you don't see those words, your setup is not working right.
