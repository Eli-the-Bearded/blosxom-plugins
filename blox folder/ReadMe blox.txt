The v0.99 plugin (blox) is the latest and greatest, adding markup notation to the 
normal blox feature set. v0.98 (blox98) is offered for those with no interest in 
markup. Both versions contain the same bug fixes; all users are urged to upgrade.

Once I get the high-sign from users, v0.98 will freeze at v1.0. At its next rev, 
v0.99 will become v2.0, followed by v3.0 when Blosxom3 shows its next rev.
