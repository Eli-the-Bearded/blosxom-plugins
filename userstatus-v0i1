=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: userstatus

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides a $userstatus::status variable which will display a status message
about what the blog author is currently getting up to.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will provide a variable you can use ($userstatus::status) which
contains a brief status message about what the blog author is currently doing.
Multiple statuses can be defined, in which case the plugin will select a
random one for each page.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are three user-configurable variables to customize the operation of
userstatus.  These are as follows:

=item B<$status_datafile>: Configures the name of the file in your data
directory from which status information is read. The first line of the file
should be the blogger's name, and all other lines individual statuses.

=item B<$currently_class>: CSS class to use for the first "Mike is currently..."
paragraph.

=item B<$status_class>: CSS class for the paragraph containing the actual
status message.
