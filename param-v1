=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: param

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin provides access to parameters that may be sent from the http client. For example, a request ending in '?name=joe' would set the variable $param::name to 'joe'.

=head1 USAGE

Simply insert $param::key into your templates, where 'key' is the param that you wish to use. This plugin will automatically set the variable if it exists, so you can do an interpolate_fancy query like <?$param::key>key exists</?>, even if nothing was set as a value for param.

=head1 INSTALLATION 

Drop this plugin into your Blosxom plugins folder.
