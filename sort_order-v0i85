# Blosxom Plugin: sort_order
# Author(s): Stu
# Version: 0.85  Sept 5, 2003
#
#  There are plenty of better widgets for doing this ;-)
#
#  sort_order sorts entries by one of four methods:
#     descending file name          default
#     ascending file name           when calling url ends in "?sorder=1"
#     descending file mtime         when calling url ends in "?sorder=2"
#     ascending file mtime          when calling url ends in "?sorder=3"
#
#  sort_order also fills a var $sorderstr with an html-formatted 
#  description of the displayed sort order, and a link to reverse 
#  it; put "<p>
#           $sort_order::sorderstr
#           </p>"
#  at the end of your HEAD template to put this text "just above" 
#  your entries. Put it at the top of your FOOT template to put 
#  this text "just after" your entries. The value of $sorderstr is 
#  something like: "Entries are currently listed by descending name; to see 
#                   them listed by ascending name, click here."
#  Terms in the string adjust as appropriate.

# Insert other strings here -- such as 'aorderstr', 'borderstr', etc. -- and then 
# call them from your flavour files with '$sort_order::borderstr', etc.

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: sort-order -- allows sorting entries up or down by file name or by mod date

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Through a query string used in the url calling blosxom, sort_order will sort entry files by file name or mod date, in descending or ascending order. "?sorder=1" is asc name; "?sorder=2" is desc date; "?sorder=3" is asc date. No "sorder" query string item yields default desc name sort.
