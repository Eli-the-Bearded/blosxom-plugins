=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: error

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Uses CGI::Carp to generate errors so "die" is useful in Blosxom.

Required by the captcha plugin.  Requires CGI::Carp to be installed.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Drop the error plug-in into your Blosxom plugins folder, and name it
"00error" so it is loaded before any other plugins.  No other
configuration is needed.  Once installed, the "die" command will
trigger the contents of the "error.html" flavour file to be displayed.
