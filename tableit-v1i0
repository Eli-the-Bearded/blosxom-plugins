# TableIt
#
# Puts selected text within a single cell table.  
#
# 
# Usage:
# 
#   Include the string [tbl] in the post where you want the
#   the table to begin and [lbt] ([tbl] backwards) where you
#   want it to end.
#
# Example:
#
#   [tbl]This text would show up in a table[lbt]
#
# Configuration:
#
#   Some aspects of the table can be controlled by variables
#   set in the configuration section.  These variables are:
#
#       table_width     Defines the actual width of the table,
#                       either in pixels or in a percentage of
#                       the parent element (the web browser or
#                       another, enclosing table).  If using a
#                       percentage, suffix the number with a
#                       percent sign (%).
#       
#       table_cspacing  Defines the amount of space between
#                       cells within the table.  Irrelevant
#                       unless your enclosed text includes
#                       multiple cell definitions.
#
#       table_cpadding  Defines the amount of space between
#                       the contents of a cell and the cell
#                       boundaries.
#
#       table_border    Defines the width of the border around
#                       the table and between the cells.
#
#       table_start     Defines the HTML tags (and any other data)
#                       that will define the start of your table.
#                       May also include any header info or titles
#                       that should be displayed at the top of
#                       every table.
#
#       table_close     Defines the HTML tags (and other data) that
#                       closes your table.  May also include footer
#                       information to be appended to the bottom of
#                       every table.
#
#   For more information on these values, consult your favorite
#   HTML reference work.  If you are unsure about any of them, the
#   default values will work fine.
