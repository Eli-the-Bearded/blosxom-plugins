=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: author

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Allows an author to be individually specified for each story
with a "meta-author:" tag. A default author can also be used if no
author tag is present in the story. Shouldn't be very hard to customize
the output..not much code to sift through ;)
