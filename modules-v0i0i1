=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Allows Blosxom to bring in other perl modules for use by the other
plugins.  Simply place the modules into the $perl_module_dir, and this
module will make sure they load.

It is recommended to actually install this module under the name
00modules so it gets loaded absolutely first.
