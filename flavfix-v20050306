=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: FlavFix

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Thanks to misconfigured cgiwrap and/or virtual redirection on Apache, some webservers pass bogus PATH_INFO variables to the Blosxom script. This makes Blosxom display the infamous "Error: I'm afraid this is the first I've heard of a cgi flavoured Blosxom" message.  Joey Gibson (http://www.joeygibson.com/blog) released a diff patch to address this issue, but it breaks if you rename blosxom.cgi or put it in a subfolder.

FlavFix takes a different approach to this problem.  It compares the web server's PATH_INFO environment variable against the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable. If they match, the plugin takes action-- clearing the $blosom::path_info variable and setting the $blosxom::flavour variable to the default flavour value.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Drop the plugin into your $blosxom::plugin directory. No additional configuration should be required. The $oldpath variable is used for debugging purposes-- put it in one of your templates if you want to see what crazy PATH_INFO stuff your webserver is passing to Blosxom.
