=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: xref

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin is designed to enable blosxom users to 'cross post' articles under multiple categories.

=head1 PREQUISITES

None.

=head1 DETAILS

To use this plugin, it's important to understand the model being used.  Blosxom works best knowing that each file it finds corresponds to a post.  The plugin aims to play to that strength.

To cross-post an article, create a text file in the location where you wish the cross-post to show up.  This file can have anything you want in it, but there MUST be one line that looks like the following:

  xref: path/to/file.txt

At the minimum, then, the file need only have that line.

When this plugin encounters that line, it opens up the file at $blosxom::datadir/path/to/file.txt and first checks to see if it has any xrefs in it. If it does, then it continues to search the file indicated by the xref.  If a real article is found, the contents of the article are parsed into title and body, and the results are 'pasted in place' of the original xref file.

Because of the way this plugin works, it's probably clear by now that it is absolutely imperative that it be the first to load.

This system is extremely flexible. If you want to move an xref post to another location, do so and the system automatically compensates.

If you want to relocate the *original article* to a new location, however, do so, but create an xref post in the vacated position so that old xref posts have a path to follow to get to the article.

A future release will incorporate the ability to 'repair' xref posts so that they always point to the original article instead of another xref post.  In this way it will be possible to contain the number of xref posts to an absolute minimum.

You should also be aware of another consequence of this system.  All articles showing up in the xref'ed location will have the xref'ed location's date/time stamp.  At this point in time, I'm choosing to call that a feature, not a bug (seriously).  If this is undesirable, you can always touch the xref post to match the timestamp of the original.

This plugin is believed to work flawlessly in static mode, but hasn't been tested at this time.

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION
