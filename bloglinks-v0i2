=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: bloglinks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides a $bloglinks::bloglinks variable which will display a set of links
to other blogs as listed in a bloglinks.list file in your data directory.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will provide a variable you can use ($bloglinks::bloglinks) to cause
Blosxom to read in a list of other blogs and generate a list of them. Each
link has a URL, a label for the link, and a description for the link. The URL
and label generate a paragraph, as does the description.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are seven user-configurable variables to customize the operation of
bloglinks. These are as follows:

=item B<$bloglinks_datafile>: Name of the file in your data directory
from which the list of blog links will be read

=item B<$link_label_class>: CSS class name for the URL and label paragraphs

=item B<$link_label_prepend>: Text to be placed before each link label

=item B<$link_label_append>: Text to be placed after each link label

=item B<$link_description_class>: CSS class name for the description paragraphs

=item B<$link_description_prepend>: Text to be placed before each link description

=item B<$link_description_append>: Text to be placed after each link description
