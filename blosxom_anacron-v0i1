# Blosxom Plugin: blosxom_anacron

# Version: 0.1
package blosxom_anacron;

# This plugin performs a similar purpose as the anacron utility
# It reads the anacrontab file which specifies commands and 
# how frequently they should be run.
# When a blosxom page is loaded, the plugin checks to see if any commands
# are overdue to be run, and if so, runs them. 

# --- Configurable variables -----

# anacron_tab is the file that you need to prepare.  The format consists
# of the command to be run, followed by "=>" followed by the interval
# in seconds.
#
# For example:
# /path/to/command=>86400
# 'command' will be run every 24 hours

$anacron_tab = "$blosxom::plugin_state_dir/anacrontab";

# This file stores the timestamps of the last time a command was run
# This file is created automatically.
$anacron_timestamp = "$blosxom::plugin_state_dir/anacronstamp";
