=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: multiblosxom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Supports the use of config files based on the name by which blosxom is called.

=head1 ABSTRACT

Under unix, symbolic links can be made to the blosxom script, and
those links can be used to run the script.  With this plugin, blosxom
can be made to use a different config file for each link.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make links to a single blosxom.cgi script:

 ln -s blosxom.cgi blog.cgi
 ln -s blosxom.cgi comments.cgi
 ln -s blosxom.cgi news.cgi

Modify this plugin's $config_base variable, and place config files there
with names based on the script links, ending in .config:

 conf/blog.cgi.config
 conf/comments.cgi.config
 conf/news.cgi.config

Now, when the script is called by one of the links, this plugin will load
the corresponding config file.
