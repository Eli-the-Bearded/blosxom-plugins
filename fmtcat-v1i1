# FmtCat
#
# Formats Categories nicely with separators.
# 
# Usage:
# 
#   Simply include "$fmtcat::fmtcat" in your story flavour file
#   where you want the formatted category to show up.
#
# Configuration:
#
#   There are three variables that control what this plugin does
#   and what the output looks like.  See the configuration section
#   for a complete description of each.
#
# Update History:

# Configuration Section
#

# There are five variables that can be changed to control how
# fmtcat works.  They are:
#
# cap_flag       - Controls capitalization of categories
# spacer         - Defines category separator
# home_text      - Defines a top level category name
# cat_flag       - Controls directory name replacement
# category_names - Lists human readable category names for
#                  directories
#
# Each is described in detail below.  The default values are
# all valid so you don't even have to do anything, if you don't
# mind your categories looking the way mine do.

#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# cap_flag controls whether or not each level of the category
# tree is to be capitalized.  If set to "Y", then the first
# letter of each category level will be capitalized.  For example,
#
# food/dinner/meat
#
# would become
#
# Food/Dinner/Meat
#
# If you don't want capitalization, (You know who you are, e. e.)
# set this flag to "N" (or, actually, any value other than "Y").

$cap_flag       = "Y";

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# spacer is the text that will separate each level of the
# category tree.  Possible spacers include:
#
#    Spacer     Description     Sample
#    ------     --------------  ---------------------------
#    " > "      Yahoo Style     Food > Dinner > Meat
#    " :: "     Arts & Crafts   Food :: Dinner :: Meat
#    " | "      Unix Geek       Food | Dinner | Meat
#    ", "       Librarian       Food, Dinner, Meat
#
# Feel free to make up your own, of course.  Also, there doesn't
# seem to be any reason that this couldn't be an <img> tag to
# use a graphic as the spacer instead.

$spacer         = " :: ";

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# home_text is used to add a top level category to the category
# tree.  If you don't want one, uncomment the first definition
# by removing the number sign (#) at the start of the line and
# adding one at the start of the second definition (the line
# where it is given the value "Home" by default.
#
# Examples:
#
# Given a hierarchy of:
#
#       /Food
#       /Food/Dinner/
#       /Food/Dinner/Meat
#       /Food/Dinner/Veg
#       /Drink
#       /Drink/Coffee
#       /Drink/Coffee/Sumatra
#
# With a home_text of "Home", and a spacer of " > ", these would be
# displayed as follows:
#
#       Home > Food
#       Home > Food > Dinner
#       Home > Food > Dinner > Meat
#       Home > Food > Dinner > Veg
#       Home > Drink
#       Home > Drink > Coffee
#       Home > Drink > Coffee > Sumatra
#
# With no home_text defined and the same spacer, the categories
# would look like this:
#
#       Food
#       Food > Dinner
#       Food > Dinner > Meat
#       Food > Dinner > Veg
#       Drink
#       Drink > Coffee
#       Drink > Coffee > Sumatra
#
# It's your choice as to what you prefer.  It seems to me that if you
# never post stories at that top level, you would probably not want a
# home_text defined.  If you do, then might want one.

# Remove the number sign from this line to disable the home category

#$home_text;

# Put your text in this variable (and leave the previous line alone)
# if you want a top level category added.  Possible values include
# "Home", "Top", your journal name, or whatever you like.

$home_text      = "Home";

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# cat_flag controls whether or not to check the directory name against
# a list (see Category_Names below) to get a nicer, more natural
# category name.  Set it to "Y" (the default) to turn on this feature,
# "N" to turn it off.  Basically, if this flag is on, FmtCat goes
# through the list of directories in Category_Names and if it finds any,
# swaps them for the nicer description.  For example, if the list
# included "rovers" which had a description of "Land Rovers":
#
#                      'rovers' => 'Land Rovers'
#
# then any entries in the rovers directory would have, instead,
# "Land Rovers" in the formatted category string.  Any directories
# not found would be left the same.  That is, if "rovers" was the
# only directory in the list, then "home" would not be changed.
 
  $cat_flag          = "Y";

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# category_names is the list of directories and the text to be
# displayed for each.  If no change is necessary (that is, you
# want "family" to stay "family"), then it need not be included
# in this list.  Anything, however, that you do want translated
# for display should be listed.
#
# The format is simple:
#
#                       '[dir]'  => '[display]'
#
# Separate multiple pairs with a comma:
#
#                       'fred'   => 'Fredrick Flinstone',
#                       'barney' => 'Barney Rubble'
#
# Note that the last pair should not have a comma.
#
  %category_names    = (
                        'rovers' => 'Land Rovers',
                        'home'   => 'House and Home'
                       );
