=head1 NAME

Blosxom plugin: wordcount

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Counts the number of words in a story, excluding HTML. This
count is then available as $wordcount::wordcount.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Drop wordcount and plain_text into your plugins directory, and
make sure plain_text loads first. To do this, just rename the plugin
files and start them with numbers, and make the number lower for
plain_text than it is for wordcount. For instance, on my machine
I've renamed plain_text to 03plain_text and wordcount to
04wordcount.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None: once you've dropped it into your plugin directory,
$wordcount::wordcount is available to use in your story templates.
