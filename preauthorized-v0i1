# --- Configurable variables -----

# Where is your excludefile - this controls which user is able to see which 
# files the excludefile is built using regular expressions in the format:
# user=page
# user is a regexp to match allowed user (.* matches all VALIDATED users)
# page is a regexp to match pages or directories (.* matches all pages)
#
# Examples:
# A blank or nonexistent file allows full access to anyone, logged in or not
# myusername=.*
#	Only someone logged in as myusername can access any files on the 
#       web site
# (myuser1|myuser2)=private
#	Only these two people can access a file or directory named private, 
#       private1, privatestuff, etc
# .*=priv$
#	Any VALIDATED user can view the directory named priv, but this 
#       doesn't affect one named private
#
# 
my $excludefile = "$blosxom::datadir/requireuser";

    Blosxom Plug-in: preauthorized

    =head1 DESCRIPTION

    Preauthorized performs filtering of content as per the login plugin, 
    however it relies on the blog reader having already authenticated 
    themself via a .htaccess type approach.
    The file, $excludefile, defines which users can access certain parts of 
    your site.  The format for the files is explained above.
