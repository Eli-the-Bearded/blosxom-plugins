Blosxom Plug-in: output_utf8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Encodes the output of Blosxom and previous plugins to UTF-8. 
The plugin is called via 'last'. The variable $entries is left unchanged 
and returned to Blosxom. No configurable variables available. 
Just drop it in your plugin directory. 
Caveat: Make sure that the input to this plugin doesn't contain UTF-8 
sequences, otherwise strange results may occur.
