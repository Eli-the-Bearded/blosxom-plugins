__DATA__

=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: exclude

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: ignores files and directories in entries. Still allow these stories to appear in the results of a search via Fletcher T. Penney's find plugin <http://fletcher.freeshell.org>
 
This file does not make any new variables available for use in template files.

=head1 VERSION

2004-09-13blosxom2

1st test release

=head1 AUTHOR

Barijaona Ramaholimihaso http://homepage.mac.com/barijaona/
The original exclude plugin was written by Breyten J. Ernsting <bje@dds.nl> http://www.bje.nu/
Compatibility with the find plugin provided by Fletcher Penney.

=head1 BUGS

Probably ;)
IMPORTANT : Needs a specially hacked version of blosxom available in Barijaona's blosxom starter kit.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

C<$ign_file> name to use for exclude files. Defaults to C<exclude>.

C<$refdir> directory where you put the exclude files. The default is your flavourdir. Some people might prefer the datadir.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Your C<.exclude> file should look like this:

apps/
life/about.txt

One entry per line. You should be able to use regexes.
