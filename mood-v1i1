=head1 NAME

Blosxom plugin: mood

=head2 SYNOPSIS

Mood

Mood retrieves $meta::mood from a meta-mood tag within an entry file and
uses it to provide either a textual or graphical representation of the mood.
Requires Blosxom plugin: meta

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Note: Be sure you have Blosxom plugin meta installed!

1. Set all user-configured variables according to their instructions. It is
important that the final tag of $pre be left without its closing angle
bracket, as a title attribute is inserted by the script later.

2. If you plan on using mood icons, uncomment the "require" line (#28) and
copy moodlist.pl to your plugin state directory.

3. Put mood icons in the $imgdir and edit moodlist.pl to associate images with moods.

4. Add $mood::text or $mood::img in your story template.

5. Declare p.mood and img.mood in your stylesheet if desired.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some variables which may come in handy are:

$mood::text, which places a textual representation of any mood tag found
$mood::img, which places a textual, and when available, graphical repre-
sentation of any mood tag found

These variables are not strictly useful, but they may be handy for integrating
Mood into your Blosxom.
$mood::src, the web path of the mood icon
$mood::itag, the completed image tag, with trailing linebreak
$mood:moodcap, the mood name, capitalized for user-friendliness

A minor hack could use the $flavour bit as the directory, and then pull the
image from a directory corresponding to the flavour. However, the implications
of having a mood defined, with only graphics for some flavours is that, if
you're not careful, you could end up with 404-image icons on some of your posts.
